# AI Phishing Email Detection and Generation

This project includes a **fine-tuned GPT-2 model** for phishing email generation and a **fine-tuned BERT model** for phishing email detection. It also features a GUI built with `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap`.

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Phishing email generation using GPT-2
- 🔍 Email classification using BERT
- 🖥 Desktop GUI for both generation and detection
- 🧪 Support for retraining models using your own dataset

## 🛠 Setup

1. Clone the repository and open terminal in project root.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv chatbot_env
chatbot_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows


Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 Run the App
python chatbot/chatbot_gui.py


Retrain Models

If you want to retrain:
# GPT-2 Generator
python generator/train_generator.py
# BERT Detector
python detector/train_detector.py


Since i am unable to upload Offline AI models
please run the train detector and train generator python codes
before the Main code so that the
Ai models can be trained and saved online and
feel free to use the data i have given or pick one from kaggel 
ENJOY!!!

Make sure your data is cleaned and located in data/processed/balanced_cleaned_emails.csv
